**Description:**
* JavaScript code renders hour blocked rows with the time of the hour slot, a color-coded input field, and a save button.
* Using moment.js, hour blocks will display in grey if in the past, red if in the present, and green if in the future.
* User can input text into the middle colored column, and click the save button to save that text to local storage.
* Upon navigating away from the page, or refreshing, the previously saved text will appear.
